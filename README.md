# CircularProgressBar

This project is a simple, standalone Circular Progress Bar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to gain experience in building a dynamic progress bar that visually represents the loading progress of a web page.

Project Overview
HTML: The HTML structure sets up the circular progress bar and defines its size and placement on the web page.

CSS: CSS styles were used to define the appearance of the circular progress bar, including its colors, size, and animations.

JavaScript: The core logic for the circular progress bar is implemented in JavaScript. It calculates and updates the loading progress as the web page loads.
